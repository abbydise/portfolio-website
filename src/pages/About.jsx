				<p className="mb-5">
					Hello! I'm a third year Computer Science studying at
					Drexel University with a Computer Engineering minor. My
					obsession for technology started when I was very young
					and grew into the passion I have today that lead me to
					pursuing my degree.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					I'm particularly interested in roles surrounding
					full-stack development and AI/ML. I have just completed
					my first co-op which gave me experience in Java and
					Kotlin.
				</p>
				<p className="mb-5">
					My goal is to work at a company that values
					collaboration and professional development and also
					allows me opportunities to grow.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outside of programming, I enjoy reading, playing
					guitar, and playing on my Playstation 5. Reading and
					playing video games helps me hone my strategic thinking
					while guitar playing gives me a healthy and creative
					outlet to relieve stress.
