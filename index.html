			<h2>About Me!</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Abigail Dise. I am a pre-junior at Drexel
				University in Philadelphia, PA. My major is in Computer
				Science and my minor is in Computer Engineering. I have a
				background in Computer Information Systems, but my primary
				focus is software development.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began my programming journey in middle school where I
				first started learning Python through a mobile app on my
				phone. I have since learned multiple languages through
				various platforms. I have the most experience in Python,
				HTML & CSS, and JavaScript. The tech stack I am most
				familiar with for web development is the MERN stack
				(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
			</p>
			<p>
				I am more than willing and capable to learn what I need to
				for any position. I am a quick and active learner as I love
				to learn new things constantly. I will put in the effort to
				be the employee a company needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal for this website is to showcase my skills and create
				a central point for the information necessary for potential
				employers or future collaborators to learn a bit more about
				me. There are 3 main sections to my website -- Education,
				Experience, and Projects. Please consider viewing each page
				as they provide more details. My contact information is in
				the footer of each page if you wish to contact me as well!
