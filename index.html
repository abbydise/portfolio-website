			<h2>About Me!</h2>
			<p>
				Hello, my name is Abigail Dise. I am a pre-junior at Drexel
				University in Philadelphia, PA. My major is in Computer
				Science and my minor is in Computer Engineering. I have a
				background in Computer Information Systems, but my primary
				focus is software development.
			</p>
			<p>
				My main skills are in Python and web development, but I am
				willing and capable of learning new technologies. I am
				currently in the process of learning React Native and
				Spring.
			</p>
			<p>
				I began my programming journey in middle school where I
				first started learning Python through a mobile app on my
				phone. As I grew to love coding more, I subscribed to an
				online service called Codecademy which provided me with a
				more well-rounded instruction in various programming
				languages. I have since learned Java, Javascript, HTML & CSS
				(obviously), and SQL.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal for this website is to showcase my skills and create
				a central point for the information necessary for potential
				employers or future collaborators to learn a bit more about
				me. There are 3 main sections to my website -- Education,
				Experience, and Projects. Please consider viewing each page
				as they provide more details. My contact information is in
				the footer of each page if you wish to contact me as well!
